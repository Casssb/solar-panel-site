            We’re actually saving about £150 a month on our light bill from what it used to be. And it was shocking to see one month our bill was only
            £10. We love showing off our bill because people don’t really believe it. It’s fun. I love the reactions we get.

            We chose SoLong because of the warranties that they offered, the sales process, the salesperson, everybody that we spoke to within the
            company. Even referrals had nothing but great things to say so about them, so it made perfect sense for us to take that next step.

            I could not recommend them more highly. They were friendly, professional, and worked extremely hard, for a very fair price. They are
            registered as govt EV installers so they can get the govt grant on your behalf as well. For anyone wanting an EV charge point installed,
            this is the company you should be using!!

            When you consider the benefits I’m getting with no upfront investment, you have to wonder why every business isn’t installing solar. The
            return on investment with solar is phenomenal. The low cost of ownership thanks to the Government grant, plus the electricity savings,
            adds up to a significant impact on our bottom line profitability, while we do something good for the planet at the same time.
